The goal of the game is to achieve the highest score possible. The player's score can be increased in the following ways:
	- Reach the water at the far end of the game screen for ONE point.
	- Collect one of the gems that appear: a blue gem is worth FIVE points; a green gem is worth TEN points; an orange gem is worth TWENTY points.

The enemy bug characters must be avoided by the player. Collision with an enemy will reduce the player's lives by ONE. If the player has no lives left, then the game is over. The player may increase their number of lives by collecting the hearts that appear on-screen: a heart increases by ONE the player's lives.

Gems and hearts will disappear from the game screen if they collide with an enemy bug, or with one another.

In order to restart the game after running out of lives, refresh the browser.
